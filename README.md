Autism Spectrum Disorder is a serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact. Currently, doctors have limited resources to perform screening and diagnosis of Autism. 
Building an app which uses Artificial Intelligence model will significantly help doctors in decision making and saving time and costs.

My project aims to detect ASD in children aiding doctors and pediatricians.

ALGORITHM -
I have implemented Support Vector Machine which is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is used for classification and regression on the dataset. 

The dataset used for this project contains facial images of autistic children.

FUTURE SCOPE - To develop an online web application whereby parents can submit one (or better yet several) images of
their child and receive a returned probability of the potential of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
